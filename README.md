# Mussy-Robot
Code for a human-aware music-playing robot.

# Installation
To use the code, you have to install some packages. Using *pip*, this is possible by executing `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

In order to use the file `google_play_music.py`, you need a [Google Play Music](https://play.google.com/music/) email and password. You need to make a file called `config.py` and fill your email and password in there. An example is given in `config_example.py`.
